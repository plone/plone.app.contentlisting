Changelog
=========

1.0.6 (unreleased)
------------------

- Introduce ``@@contentlisting`` view, which is also supports Collections from
  plone.app.contenttypes including filtering of results. This gives us a
  unified interface for listing content from Folders or Collections.
  Deprecate ``@@folderListing``, which is kept for BBB compatibility.

------------------

1.0.3 (2012-10-29)
------------------

- Whoever heard I liked batching was wrong. The Catalog results are
  already batched, so don't batch them again.

------------------

- Nothing changed yet.


1.0.1 (2012-04-15)
------------------

- Change ContentTypeClass to return contenttype-{portal_type} to match
  what the rest of Plone expects. This fixes sprite based icons for 
  pages/documents.
